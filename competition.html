                  <p>Formula Hybrid is a design and engineering challenge for university students held annually during the spring at the New Hampshire Motor Speedway. The goal is to design, build, and compete an open-wheel, single-seat, electric or hybrid-electric race car. This car must conform to a formula which emphasizes innovation and efficiency.</p>

                     <p> The competition evaluates the carâ€™s performance through acceleration, autocross and endurance events. Additionally, the team is judged on its project success through evaluation of the Project Management tactics the team undertook throughout the build of the Formula Hybrid vehicle. Along with the overall engineering design of the car, points are awarded based on whether a feature was designing from scratch  or implemented with off-the-shelf components.  Below is a graphical representation of weighting of each event.

                      Check out the <a href="http://www.formula-hybrid.org/">Formula Hybrid International Competition website</a> for more information.</p>
